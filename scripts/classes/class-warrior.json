Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each warrior specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.","B":"i wish to see the other options again;I am Warrior","C":"Cancel","V":0.0,"N":"","Condition":{"Key":"None","Operator":1.0,"Value":0.0}},{"PartId":"875087744","StepType":10.0,"A":"","B":"5||>0","C":"I am Warrior","V":0.0,"N":"","Condition":{"Key":"None","Operator":1.0,"Value":0.0}},{"PartId":"713858432","StepType":0.0,"A":"You choose Warrior.
