Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.","B":"i wish to see the other options again;I am Druid","C":"Cancel","V":0.0,"N":"","Condition":{"Key":"None","Operator":1.0,"Value":0.0}},{"PartId":"142460400","StepType":10.0,"A":"","B":"5||>0","C":"I am Druid","V":0.0,"N":"","Condition":{"Key":"None","Operator":1.0,"Value":0.0}},{"PartId":"58198800","StepType":0.0,"A":"You choose Druid.
